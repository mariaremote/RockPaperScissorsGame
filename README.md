# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

This simple Rock-Paper-Scissor Browser Game I built using this [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/1yS-JV4fWqY).

## Description

The user has a selection of hand emojis at the top to choose from. 

Once clicked, the computer's choice will be revealed and the game history will be displayed below highlighting the winning hand. 

Simultaneously there is a score for each player that keeps track of their victories. 

## My Spin on this

- Added an additional `Spock` hand that shows up randomly (25% chance) and can beat all other hands. The computer will play this hand also at the same probability. 

- Added a "fade-out" in the game history to only ever show the last `6` games played
